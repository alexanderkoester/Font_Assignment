    <h1>Dark Days</h1>
    <h2>Local Natives</h2>

<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<p>what you came for
Finally what you hoped to <strong>find</strong>
<span class="write-rl">Racing</span>home from her house
<em>Looking out for black and white</em>
<span class="bigger">Dark days in the summer</span>
A million ways to toe the <strong>line</strong>
Can't wait, holy other
Might as well be the seventh <strong>sign</strong>
</p> 

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<p>Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the afterlife
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why?
</p>

<h3>[Verse 2: Nina Persson]</h3>
<p>While the dollar is <span class="highlight">strong</span>
While nobody else <span class="write-rl">relies</span>
When they turn the corner
<em>When you know we're out of sight</em>
<span class="bigger">Dark days in the summer</span>
In the rain the water's <strong>fine</strong>
It was wild combination
Either that or right down the <strong>line</strong>
</p>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<p>Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the <span class="write-rl">afterlife</span>
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why?
</p>

<h3>[Outro]</h3>
<p>I've been on the way
I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so <span class="highlight">long</span>
I've been on the way
I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so <span class="highlight">long</span>
</p>
